<h1> Arduino Powered Parking Assistant </h1>

This project is an Arduino powered parking assistant. Its purpose is to help drivers park in the garage at the ideal distance. It uses the same light configuration (green-go, yellow-slow/caution, red-stop) to inform drivers of their general location in the garage. The red and yellow light distances are configured with a press of a button, and this information is retained even when the Arduino is powered down.
